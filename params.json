{"name":"Contech","tagline":"High-Performance, Parallel Program Instrumentation","body":"Contech is a compiler-based (specifically [LLVM](http://llvm.org)) instrumentation, designed to efficiently record the execution trace, memory accesses, and parallel interactions of a program.  The instrumentation has been tested across programs written in C, C++, and Fortran, as well as those using pthreads, OpenMP, and MPI.\r\n\r\nContech is documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/bprail/contech/wiki/Contech).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@bprail is the software architect of this project.  Contributions have also been made by @ehein6.  Additional components have been provided by @caparrov.\r\n\r\n### Publication\r\nContech has appeared in the journal, [ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2776893).\r\n\r\nContech appeared as a tutorial as [IISWC 2015](http://www.iiswc.org/iiswc2015/index.html).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
