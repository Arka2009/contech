      <p>Contech is a compiler-based (specifically <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a>) instrumentation, designed to efficiently record the execution trace, memory accesses, and parallel interactions of a program.  The instrumentation has been tested across programs written in C, C++, and Fortran, as well as those using pthreads, OpenMP, and MPI.</p>

<p>Contech is documented in the <a href="https://github.com/bprail/contech/wiki/Contech">wiki</a>.</p>
